# Reproducibility Challenge - Adversarial Dropout for Supervised and Semi-Supervised Learning
This project attemted to reproduce the results of the following paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03631
Only supervised training with MNIST and CIFAR10 were attempted.

## Getting Started
You must have Python 3 installed to run the code. Run the command below to install the relevant dependencies, perferably in a virtual environment:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Code
The relevant code are in the following files:
* AdD.ipynb - Contains the code for Baseline and Adversarial Dropout supervised training for CIFAR10
* MNISTAdD.ipynb - Contains the code for Baseline and Adversarial Dropout supervised training for MNIST
